title: Competition dates for SR2016 announced
---

The competition venue and dates for SR2016 have now been confirmed. Once again
the competition will return to the Newbury Racecourse Grandstand which has
successfully hosted the competition over the past two years.

The competition weekend will be the 30th April and 1st May. Over the two day
event the teams' robots will first compete in a series of league matches, during
which they will continue to improve their hardware and software. These matches
will then seed a knockout to choose the overall winners.

In each match the robots will play Sunny Side Up, in which the aim is to turn as
many of the nine tokens the right way up and then collect as many as they can
into their home zone.

In addition to the coveted 1st, 2nd and 3rd prizes, there are awards for the
highest placed new team, the most ingenious robot and the best presented team
among others. For full details of the rules of the game and the prizes available
see the rulebook.

Whether you're supporting a team or just want to watch, the competition is open
to everyone over the whole weekend. We particularly recommend coming along for
the finals on Sunday afternoon.
